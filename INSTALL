Installation Instructions
*************************

./autogen.sh 
./configure
make

To continue, and build a tar ball

make dist

To build the source and binary rpms from that tar ball

rpmbuild -ta *.tar.gz

Often, its useful to try to build a binary rpm from the source rpm

cd .....?? /rpm/SRPM
rpm -i llnl-curses-jni-libs-1.0.0-5.ch5.src.rpm
cd .....??/rpm/SPECS
rpmbuild -ba llnl-curses-jni-libs.spec

Now the source and binary rpms exist in the appropriate build dirs

cd ....??/rpm/RPMS/x86_64
ls -lart
